# Exercise: Print

## Instructions

Complete the code to make the program print "Mary is 20 years old" to the standard output.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val name = "Mary"
    val age = 20
    // Write your code here
}
```
## Solution
To solve this exercise, you can use the **println()** function and string interpolation. Here's the completed code:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val name = "Mary"
    val age = 20
    println("$name is $age years old")
}
```
In this solution, we use string interpolation to combine the **name** and **age** variables with the desired message and print it using **println()**.

Make sure to test the code and verify that it prints the expected output.

Good luck!
