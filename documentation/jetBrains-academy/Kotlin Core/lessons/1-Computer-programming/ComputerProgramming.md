# Introduction to Computer Programming
Simply put, computer programming is a way to make computers do different tasks. It involves writing a set of instructions, also known as code, that a machine can understand and follow. The end goal could be anything from solving a mathematical equation to automating a repetitive task or creating complex software applications, mobile apps, or even games.

Computer programming combines technical skills with creative thinking, often regarded as both a science and an art.

## Understanding Instructions and Programming Languages
To write these sets of instructions, we need to think of computers as foreign time-traveling friends who only understand their native language. Just like when communicating with someone who doesn't speak your language, you have to provide clear and precise descriptions for every action you want the computer to perform. In our analogy, computers are like friends from the 12th century who know nothing about the present.

For example, instead of instructing your computer to "call Steve from accounting," you would need to describe each step in detail:

1. Pick up the phone.
2. Push the button to turn on the screen.
3. Swipe the phone to unlock it.
4. Open the Contacts app.
5. Enter "Steve from accounting" into the search bar.
6. Open Steve's contact details.
7. Push the Call button.
Additionally, computers don't understand human languages like English or French. They comprehend programming languages such as C, Python, or Java. Although computers only understand machine code, which is a low-level language, software developers use compilers to translate their source code into machine code. However, we won't dive into those technical details here.

There are over a thousand programming languages, with old ones evolving and new ones emerging. The popularity of programming languages is constantly changing. Below is a list of the most popular programming languages as of March 2023, according to PYPL Popularity of Programming Language. For up-to-date information, it's best to visit their website.

Each programming language has its own goals, strengths, and areas of application. Some languages are more challenging, while others are simpler and widely used. However, it's important to note that programming languages share common concepts, just like how different spoken languages share parts, constructions, and concepts. Learning a new programming language can be as difficult or easy as learning a foreign spoken language. If you understand the sentence "I can write" in English, grasping the concept of "ich kann schreiben" in German won't be too challenging.

## Choosing a Programming Language
When selecting a programming language, it's essential to consider the type of work you want to pursue. This brings us back to the "make computers do tasks" aspect. Think about why you want to learn to code. Do you aspire to become a game developer? Are you interested in creating mobile applications? Do you aim to build websites? Or perhaps you need programming skills for scientific or statistical data analysis?

Each field has its set of preferred programming languages. For example, web development distinguishes between front-end and back-end development.

Front-end development focuses on the visible part of a website—the design, fonts, colors, sliders, panels, and menus. It involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, akin to the interior design of a house. On the other hand, back-end development is comparable to constructing a house, involving servers, applications, and databases. Back-end developers build and maintain these components using languages like PHP, Python, Java, and others.

Choosing a programming language is more about selecting the field you want to work in rather than solely the language itself. If you want to develop Android apps, Kotlin is a suitable choice. Swift is commonly used for iOS apps, while C or C++ are popular for game development. If your motivation is solely to earn a substantial income, considering the most widely used programming languages is a good starting point.

## What to Expect and the Rewards
Programming can feel like a routine task at times, but it can also be like banging your head against a brick wall in the middle of a desert. Yet, many people find immense joy in it. Programming encompasses more than just languages, syntax, and compilers; it involves a logical thinking process that can be incredibly rewarding. There's never a definitive "best" solution to a problem—you constantly strive to make it faster, better, and more substantial.

Programming teaches you to think differently. It encourages you to explore how things work and understand why they operate in specific ways. The coding process feels like an ongoing puzzle that you continuously attempt to solve.

Patience is a virtue in programming. It can be one of the most stressful and frustrating endeavors. Many beginners get discouraged and give up when their code doesn't work on the first try. However, this is a normal part of the process. Even experienced programmers face moments when their code fails, and they struggle to figure out why. Patience and perseverance are key traits that have propelled successful programmers to where they are today.

Ultimately, programming is a skill that requires time and effort to master.
