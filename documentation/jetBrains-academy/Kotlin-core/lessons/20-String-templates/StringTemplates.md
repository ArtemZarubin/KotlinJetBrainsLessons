# String Templates
In this lesson, we will explore string templates in Kotlin. String templates provide a convenient way to include variable values and expressions within strings. Let's dive into their purpose and usage.

## Introduction to String Templates
String templates allow us to insert variable values into a string and build dynamic messages or texts. Instead of manually concatenating strings and variables, we can use string templates to achieve the same result in a more readable and concise manner.

## Basic Variable Interpolation
To include the value of a variable within a string, we can use the dollar sign **$** followed by the variable name. The variable's value will be automatically inserted into the string. Here's an example:

```kotlin
val city = "Paris"
val temp = "24"

println("Now, the temperature in $city is $temp degrees Celsius.")
```
In the above example, the values of the variables **city** and **temp** are interpolated within the string using string templates. The resulting string is: "Now, the temperature in Paris is 24 degrees Celsius."

Using string templates makes the code more readable and eliminates the need for explicit string concatenation.

## Expressions in String Templates
String templates also allow us to include the result of arbitrary expressions within a string. To do this, enclose the expression within curly braces **{}** after the dollar sign **$**. Here's an example:

```kotlin
val language = "Kotlin"
println("$language has ${language.length} letters in the name")
```
In the above example, we use the expression **${language.length}** within the string template to retrieve the length of the **language** variable and include it in the string. The resulting output is: "Kotlin has 6 letters in the name."

By using curly braces, we can evaluate any expression and include its result in the string template.

## Idioms: String Interpolation
Idioms are established patterns or practices that enhance the clarity and readability of code. String interpolation is an idiom in Kotlin that encourages the use of string templates for variable interpolation. It is considered a best practice in Kotlin coding style. Here's an example:

```kotlin
val language = "Kotlin"
println("Have a nice $language!")        // Good practice
println("Have a nice " + language + "!") // Less preferred
```
In the above example, the first line uses string interpolation with the **variable** language directly embedded within the string using **$language**. This is the preferred and idiomatic way to achieve string interpolation in Kotlin. The second line demonstrates the less preferred method of string concatenation using the **+** operator.

## Conclusion
In this lesson, we covered string templates in Kotlin. We learned how to interpolate variable values within strings using the dollar sign **$** and include expressions within curly braces **{}** in string templates. We also discussed the idiom of string interpolation and its benefits for writing clear and readable code.

Remember the following key points:

1. Use string templates to insert variable values into a string: "**This string has $value**".
2. Use curly braces for expressions in string templates: "The length is **${str.length}**".

By utilizing string templates effectively, you can create dynamic and expressive strings in your Kotlin code.
